Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Attack simulation instances is clearly open to public throup ssh in untrusted public subnet. 
This leaves the instance volunrable to attacks.

# Poor practice 2
Attack simulation instance is using API credentials, which can be stolen to access unauthorized resources. 
Generally, API credentials should be repaced by roles for more security on the resources.
