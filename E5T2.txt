# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
    - Regula
    - TFLint
    - Terrafirma

### Example vulnerability
Regula iam_admin_policy	ensures that IAM policies should not have full ":" administrative privileges
Regula s3_bucket_sse ensures Server Side Encryption (SSE) by default should be set for S3 buckets

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
    - trivy
    - Aqua Security
    - Anchore Container Image Scanner

### Example vulnerability
Prevent unauthorized images by ontinuously scan images to ensure changes do not introduce vulnerabilities, bad configurations, or secrets into container images

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
    - AWS Config
    - AWS Security Hub

### Example vulnerability

AWS Config can detect risks like S3 default encryption, and use of SSM for managing instances.
AWS Security Hub can detect risks in Security Groups, where too much is exposed (i.e 22 port to internet)
