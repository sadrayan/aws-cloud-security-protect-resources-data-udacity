Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

These issues are result of running AWS Config.

EC2:
securityhub-ec2-instance-managed-by-ssm-edebbab5 (Checks whether the Amazon EC2 instances in your account are managed by AWS Systems Manager.)

For all 3 S3 buckets:
securityhub-s3-bucket-replication-enabled-abc5a118 (Checks whether S3 buckets have cross-region replication enabled.)
securityhub-s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only-0eb5dcc8 (Checks whether S3 buckets have policies that require requests to use Secure Socket Layer (SSL).)
securityhub-s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled-10073f6a (Checks that your Amazon S3 bucket either has Amazon S3 default encryption enabled or that the S3 bucket policy explicitly denies put-object requests without server side encryption.)
securityhub-s3-bucket-logging-enabled-a6b5d203 (Checks whether logging is enabled for your S3 buckets.)

Based on the recommendations from AWS Inspector, we can do the following to resovle the issues:  

You can edit the Security Group sg-0aa74e5fa48592d0d to remove access from the internet on port 20, 21, 23
