# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

This solution can benefit from Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block and report malecious network traffic.
WAF provides security rules that block common attack patterns, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting, filter out specific traffic patterns 

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

As long as the S3 bucket policy is the weakest link, it wouldn't help. The default policy still allows access by any user within the VPC.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

Enabiling default encryption will only apply to future uploads, it wiould not encrypt existing objects

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

If we apply the changes directly in the console, cloudformation would override those changes. Standard practice is to update the infstruscture through CloudFormation.
