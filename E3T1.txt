# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

Brute force attack can occur when a security group leaves SSH connections from all sources (0.0.0.0/0) over Port Range 22. 
Allowing 0.0.0.0/0 over Port Range 22 introduces a security risk.

Best practice is to configure security groups to allow SSH access only from specific trusted sources, such as from bastion hosts (or secure local machine).


# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

AWS GuardDuty provides monitors and analysze VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail logs, and DNS logs to detect anomolies, such as rapid rate of login attempts. 
GuardDuty reports when an EC2 instance has been targeted in a Secure Shell (SSH) brute force attack. 
If the attacker was successful in determining the password, then the instance may be compromised.
